# Charecter Extractor
Finding the patterns using spatial domain concepts and then by using frequency domain concepts.



For this task use the image “text.png” that is available in Matlab image processing toolbox. The pattern that you should find is the letter “a” that there are six of them in this image.

# Method Explantion:

• At first I turn the image to grayscale

• And then padd orginal image for fft and correlate 2 d and then find where pattern is and after that remove pattern from original image and place 1 where the pattern find and after that sbmit where pattern fined and draw a box around that and save as image and show it for both spatial and frequency domain.

# Result:
